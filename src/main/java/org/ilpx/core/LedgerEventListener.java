/**
 * An interface that defines a listener that can listen for ledger events.
 * <p>
 * Simplistically, an implementation of this might holds events in-memory, and notify listeners directly, while a more
 * advanced implementation of this might utilize a remote messaging provider (e.g., Google Cloud PubSub) to faciliate
 * enhance retry and failover functionality.
 * <p>
 * This interface might be implemented by a Ledger running in ILP ledger-space, or a LedgerClient running in ILP
 * connector-space, for example.
 * <p>
 * NOTE: It is intended that each instance of this interface should operate on behalf of a single ledger-to-connector
 * relationship.  In other words, a single instance of {@link LedgerEventListener} should not be emitting events to more
 * than a single Connector and/or Ledger.
 * <p>
 * TODO: Propose this interface to ILPCore.
